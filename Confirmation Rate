Problem Statement: Calculate User Confirmation Rate
We have two tables, Signups and Confirmations, that track user signups and their confirmation requests. The goal is to calculate the confirmation rate for each user, defined as:

confirmationÂ rate
=
numberÂ ofÂ â€™confirmedâ€™Â messages
totalÂ requestedÂ confirmationÂ messages
confirmationÂ rate= 
totalÂ requestedÂ confirmationÂ messages
numberÂ ofÂ â€™confirmedâ€™Â messages
â€‹
 
ğŸ“Œ Key Points:
The Signups table records the user_id and their signup time_stamp.
The Confirmations table logs each confirmation request for a user_id along with an action:
'confirmed' â†’ User confirmed the request.
'timeout' â†’ Request expired without confirmation.
The confirmation rate should be:
Rounded to 2 decimal places.
0.00 if the user has no confirmation requests.
Users without confirmation requests must still be included in the result.
